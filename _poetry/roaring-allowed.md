# Roaring Allowed

-   I’ve been thinking a lot about where I should fit  
    As someone whose gender has felt rather knitted together  
    By all of the thoughts that have gone through my head  
    And all of the pressures from others and things that they said

-   To deny me expression  
    To force me to question  
    To make up the reasons  
    Why when they were teasing  
    It’s all for the better  
    That every sharp word and each furious letter  
    Is for my own good.  
    And that’s how it should be  
    I do not agree.

-   I am my own woman, and while I don’t fit  
    Quite so neatly in boxes you’ve made nor sit  
    Oh so primly and act what you think of as lady-like  
    Yet I live and I love, I am dyke, I am queer  
    You may not be listening yet but I’m roaring  
    And in time you’ll hear.
