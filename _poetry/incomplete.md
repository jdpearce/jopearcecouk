# Incomplete

There’s things I haven’t said  
Upon the art of public speaking.  
On pouring all your thoughts  
Into some slides and maybe sneaking  
In a rhyme or two, perhaps you are a poet.  
But really you don’t have to be  
You’ve knowledge just bestow it  
Upon these lucky audiences  
Sitting and absorbing  
All the information that  
You’re nervously reporting.  
The key is your enthusiasm  
Joy in pouring out  
The things that you have learned  
Or maybe sharing doubt  
For you don’t have to be an expert  
Wise in all the things there are.  
It’s useful sharing what you think  
Of things you find bizarre.  
No one knows of everything  
And everyone has gaps  
Experience can be akin  
To having worn-out maps  
We think we know the way to go  
And well-worn routes we strut  
But that might mean we never  
Look around and find the shortcut  
It’s crucial that in every field  
We welcome those who’re new  
So take your place with pride  
And show the world what you can do.
