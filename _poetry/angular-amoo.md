# Angular - A Matter Of Opinion

-   Iâ€™ve got twenty minutes to talk about stuff  
    Iâ€™m going to try and be quick  
    Thereâ€™s a lot I could say about how things are rough  
    And why certain thought patterns stick  

-   My opinion of Angular isnâ€™t the best  
    I know that itâ€™s had many flaws  
    But I feel just the same about all of the rest  
    So the things I was seeing gave me pause  

-   How do the tools that we use every day  
    Seem to cause us such stressful reactions?  
    The choices we make and the words that we say  
    Often lead to unpleasant transactions!  

-   But why?  

-   Is the software weâ€™re using just not fit for use?  
    Are we wrong? Did we make a mistake?  
    Is Angular bad? are we making excuses  
    and should we just step on the brakes?  

-   I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s true and Iâ€™m going to explain  
    How it comes down to whatâ€™s in our head.  
    And the way that these tools interact with our brain  
    Can lead to bad feelings instead.  

-   When we offer solutions for most of their needs  
    There will always be some who bemoan  
    That theyâ€™d rather they started with all of the freedom  
    And donâ€™t really want to be shown.  

-   Yet what do we see as the projects continue?  
    The freedom to choose is restricted!  
    But isnâ€™t that just where we failed to win you?  
    Could this have been something predicted?  

-   We shouldnâ€™t be thinking of winners and losers  
    Weâ€™re not out here teaching the gospel  
    It really depends on the state of the users  
    And what ways our tools become hostile.  

-   So with that all said I should get right into it  
    This time I donâ€™t need to be terse,  
    The question arises, Iâ€™ll have to admit,  
    Am I doing the whole thing in verse?  

-   No. ðŸ˜‹
