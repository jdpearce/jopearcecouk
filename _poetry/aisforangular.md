# A is for... Angular

-   A is for Angular. The reason we’re here!  
    There’s quite a lot to it, not all of it clear  
    What I’m going to attempt is poetic oration  
    Of Angular aspects that cause consternation  
    There’s so much to say and I haven’t much time  
    I’ve got 26 letters to get through in rhyme.

-   B is for Browser, for which we all build  
    There isn’t just one, we may need polyfills  
    We test different systems as much as we’re able  
    So as not to exclude anyone from our table.

-   C is for Core where we find ContentChild  
    Compiler as well which each module provides  
    Common we need as the name might suggest  
    And ComponentFixture with which we write tests

-   D is for Decorators, what are they for?  
    They make classes and methods and properties do more!  
    How do we add such syntactical sweetness?  
    They’re just functions that bring some grammatical neatness!

-   E is for Elements. Exciting and new!  
    Portable Angular components for you!  
    Not only easier to load on the fly  
    But - standards compliant - they’re consumable by  
    The other big frameworks, even plain javascript  
    There’ll be fun getting future big projects to “shipped”!

-   F is for Formats and Factories and Forms.  
    Driven by templates or is reactive the norm?  
    This is one of those areas where preference feels muddled  
    And seems like it could leave developers troubled

-   Under G we find Guards and some methods that get  
    From protecting our Routes to LocaleDateFormat  
    The methods are more or less simple enough  
    But explaining the router and guards would be tough…  
    With the time rushing onward I won’t even try  
    If I have to use more sketchy rhymes I might cry.

-   H is for Http and our Host  
    Hypertext transport is something that most  
    Of the devs in this room will probably get  
    But you may not have used the Host decorator yet  
    It tells the injector just where it should cease  
    As it tries to acquire what it needs piece by piece

-   I is for Ivy. Or Renderer3  
    Simpler and faster and small as a flea  
    Or that’s the intention it’s not quite yet done  
    But it’s out there to try if you want to have fun

-   J brings us on to JitCompilerFactory  
    About which the docs are quite unsatisfactory  
    There’s JsonPipe too which I’m sure we’ve all used  
    But as it’s impure it should not be abused  
    It’s great for debugging, seeing under the skin  
    Of components we write and the properties within.

-   K is for KeyValues used in the map  
    For detecting the changes throughout our app  
    This has left many devs feeling hopelessly wrecked  
    As they look up ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked

-   L is Location, the way we might tell  
    The parts of our app from each URL  
    The strategy used changes how the address  
    Of our pages will look and whether the mess  
    With its readable straightforward slashes and slugs  
    Will instead of all that be just hashes and bugs

-   M is for Modules and Messages and Mocks  
    While module is one of the main building blocks  
    The MessageBus may not be something you’ve found  
    It sends data between the UI and background  
    While the web worker code isn’t ready just yet  
    It’s importance will grow in the future I bet…

-   Navigation is next and the NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA  
    And of course all the classes beginning Ng\*  
    Who’d have thought that the devs of a modern creation  
    Would succumb to the need for Hungarian notation?

-   Onwards to O for OnInit, OnDestroy,  
    The decorators Optional and Output, oh joy!  
    There’s nothing that seems unfamiliar here  
    Just parts of the system we hold near and dear

-   P is for Plural a curious thing  
    If you look up the rules for outputting strings  
    For the locales your users might reasonably expect  
    The unicode CLDR has the specs.  
    I don’t recommend it for a light bedtime read  
    But for localisation it’s a doc you should heed.

-   Q is for querying all of the things.  
    We can query with types or query with strings  
    We can query the content, query the view  
    And be sure we’re updated of anything new!

-   To observe all the things we need RxJS  
    And there’s more to this lib than some docs might suggest  
    If you’re struggling with state and try NgRx  
    You’ll learn more of its breadth and at first be perplexed  
    How you ever could limit yourself to subscriptions  
    That ended with only a single emission…

-   With S we might like to consider Schematics  
    For workflow improvements they could be dramatic  
    But only if what we are hoping to gain  
    Is a better approach to the code we maintain  
    Pragmatically projects that stay fairly small  
    May not have a need for Schematics at all.

-   T is for TypeScript, not as hard as you thought  
    Although lately it seems there’s a war being fought  
    Between those of us pleased with their explicit typing  
    And others who seem to be constantly sniping  
    That javascript really was made to be free  
    And guessing what everything does is the key!

-   U brings the UpgradeModule into sight  
    And I honestly can’t recommend that you fight  
    With the hybridisation of Angular Apps,  
    Separate them by route, don’t fall into the traps  
    Of thinking that as this is something we could,  
    That means it is one of the things that we should.

-   V brings us round to ViewChild and ViewChildren  
    ViewContainerRef and ViewEncapsulation  
    I really can’t fit into here what they do  
    But note the distinction between content and view  
    There’s a DOM for the things that we View on the screen  
    And another for Content that sets up the scenes

-   W brings us to classes that look  
    As though they all start with the phrase “what the f…”  
    The intent here is not just to make you all smirk  
    WTF stands for Web Tracing Framework  
    If performance is key this may be what you’re using  
    But for everyone else we see code that’s amusing.

-   X is for XhrFactory and well…  
    What else is there under this letter to tell?  
    They’ve wrapped XMLHttpRequest  
    It’s one of the things that allows us to test!

-   Y is for You, all the people here seated  
    Who wrestle with code and remain undefeated  
    Community is something that makes us all better  
    (And frankly there’s nothing that starts with this letter)

-   Z is for Zones, about which all I’ll say  
    Is I’m hoping we no longer need them one day.  
    And that little thought is the last thing I’ll mention  
    I’m grateful you’ve lasted the course, paid attention  
    I’ve rushed through a lot in a very short time,  
    And I think now I’ve used all my Angular rhymes!
