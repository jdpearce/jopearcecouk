# I.D.T.K.M.

-   IDTKM...

-   I don’t want them to know  
    What I’m doing or how  
    I want to scream out loud but then  
    I fear I’ll be saved even when  
    I don’t think I want to be  
    Even though I don’t want me

-   IDTKM...

-   The words are always the same  
    Scoring that singular track inside my head  
    It’s a fatalist phrase that should never be said  
    And it hurts that I can’t shake myself free  
    From just a few words  
    It should be so easy  
    But something about the rhythm,  
    Those sounds  
    The intent  
    It just cycles round and around  
    Cutting deep and spitting blood  
    While I’m restrained by ought and should.

-   IDTKM...

-   Saying them is something that  
    I hope I never have to do  
    Because if I say those words aloud  
    I know that “I’ve Decided To...”
