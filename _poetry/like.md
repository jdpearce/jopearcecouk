# Like...

Like a cat being brushed the wrong way  
Like a dog seeking for a ball never thrown  
Like a car crash that takes your friends  
Like a headache that never ends  
Like sleep taking over the daylight hours  
Like insects avoiding the flowers  
Like wanting to scream when you need to be quiet  
Like trying to stay calm when you just want to riot  
Like keeping things clean  
Like trying to make sure that nothing is seen  
Like nothing and everything outside of my head  
Like what makes it inside  
Like the words that you said.
