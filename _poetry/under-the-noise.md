# Under The Noise

-   Cacophonous feelings  
    In the noise of this room  
    Are moments I’m stealing  
    From myself

-   Without seeming to do  
    Any more than just listen and write  
    I can marshal my thoughts  
    Have some peace in my head  
    Without constantly fighting  
    For space

-   With those unbidden refrains  
    Going round on their singular track  
    In my mind again and again  
    This noise, the distraction  
    Frees up that fraction  
    Of passion I have for the things  
    That I want

-   For the things that I do  
    Even for people  
    The ones that I love  
    For you

-   I look into your eyes  
    Those I see in the mirror  
    And under this blanket of noise  
    Where I’m quiet  
    I finally see her.
